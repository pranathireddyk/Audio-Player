# Project: Audio Player React App

## Overview
Create a React app that allows users to upload and play audio files, manage a playlist, and resume playback from the last position upon page reload.

## Features
- **Upload Audio Files:** Users can upload audio files (e.g., mp3) using built-in browser APIs.
- **Store Audio Files:** Audio files are stored using built-in browser APIs.
- **Playlist Management:** Show a playlist view where users can see uploaded files and manage playback.
- **Now Playing View:** Display the currently playing audio file with playback controls.
- **Playback Control:** Users can play any file from the playlist. Playback continues to the next file in the playlist upon completion.
- **Resumable Playback:** When the page is reloaded, the app should load the last playing audio file and continue playback from the last position.
- **Standard HTML Audio Player:** Use the standard built-in HTML audio player (not a third-party player).
